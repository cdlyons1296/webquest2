		  <h3>Document Overview</h3>
		  <p id="part1"><strong>Part 1: </strong>The first part is a summary and evaluation of three important human rights documents. For each document you need to:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Provide background and historical context for the document</li>
		    <li>Summarize some important rights granted by the document</li>
		    <li>Explain some drawbacks to the document (i.e. Who doesn't the document protect? Is it enforced? Are there any important rights that you think are missing?)</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p id="part2"><strong>Part 2:</strong> You will create your own document granting human rights. You can make this document apply to the entire world, a specific country, or a certain group of people.	For	this part of the document you need to consider how the world has changed since the previous documents were created. Are there rights that need to be protected now, there were not necessary in the past.	Your	document needs to:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Identify the group(s) protected by this document</li>
		    <li>Provide at least 20 rights that are protected by this document.</li>
		    <li>Explain  how this document will be enforced.</li>
	      </ul>
